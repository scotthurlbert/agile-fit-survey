This survey allows you to check your team's fit with the Agile Principles

This application is created using AngularJS.  In particular I am using the Yeoman set of scripts to 
help with the lifecycle, builds, and deployment tasks.

http://yeoman.io/index.html

Create a directory for the app.  Then from a command prompt that supports nodejs's NPM, run:

npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-angular

The directory structure of this repository is not the entire yeoman development setup.  It's the deployed web app.

However, this app was written in notepad and this would be a good place to start if you want to tweak it.

I'll post the entire dependency tree if there is interest.
